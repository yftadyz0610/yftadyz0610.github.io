<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am currently a machine learning engineer at a high-tech company focusing on NLP and its applications in real world. I have strong interest in AI and I love to do some interesting research work about it outside of work. My life has become flavorful because of this love. </p>
<h2>About MathAI Lab</h2>
<p>The mission of this lab is to fulfill artificial general intelligence (AGI) with using mature machine learning/deep learning techniques and elegant mathematical theories. In recent years, fancy AI algorithms like DeepFM, BERT have greatly boosted industrial applications and created high volume of commercial values. However, the bottleneck of these algorithms has also gradually become clear which results in the founding of this lab. We know this mission is very difficult but we'd like to contribute something to this course. We choose to fight on what's right rather than what's easy. </p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My current research interests include: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Building meta knowledge graph of natural language; </p>
</li>
<li><p>Building learning engine that relies on only relational data. </p>
</li>
</ul>
